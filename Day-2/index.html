            Today is Day-2 of my 100-days web development challenge. I learned how to use semantic html tags like header, main, section,footer and nav to provide structure to my webpage. I also added various links to other pages and added a new page, Blueprint which consists of information about the tags that I have learned so far. This has made my page more organized, readable and easier to navigate.
